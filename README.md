# QuestN

QuestN is a social media website for building gaming communities. Users are encouraged to post about their experiences with what they are currently playing, in addition to leaving hints for other players. The app is built upon a Supabase back-end, and utilises core React, along with React Query, to interface with the back-end data. Expected features as standard across modern social media are present, including different feeds, search functionality, user pages, and realtime messaging.
